# geoNotes
###About
geoNotes is a location-based app that allows users to post and view notes around their immediate location (~25 yds). 
Users can post notes at their coordinates anonymously or for specific friends to view.

###Dependancies
The GoogleMaps framework is too large to upload to github. So, when cloning this project, be sure to run 
```
pod install
```
to download all of the pods before building the application.
